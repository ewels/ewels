### Hi! I'm [@ewels](https://github.com/ewels) (Phil Ewels) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bioinformatician from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ living in Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª

I've worked in a range of different positions, I'm currently product manager for open-source software at [Seqera](https://github.com/seqeralabs/).

I created [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/), co-founded [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) and am heavily involved with [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/).
I also have a host of small side-projects, such as [SRA-explorer](https://sra-explorer.info/), [AWS-iGenomes](https://ewels.github.io/AWS-iGenomes/) and more general-use tools like [rich-click](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click) and [rich-codex](https://github.com/ewels/rich-codex).

I'm passionate about making software development best-practices available to scientists, unlocking high-throughput reproducible research to those working at the forefront of research.
